## Introduction

### What is VibesDAO?

VibesDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to create a community-driven platform for HireVibes community. The platform will allow community and other stakeholders to collaborate, share ideas, and ask for grants.

### How does it work?

VibesDAO is a DAO that is governed by the community. The community members can propose ideas, vote on proposals, and allocate funds to the projects that they believe will benefit the HireVibes ecosystem.

Now, the proposal is live on the DAO. The voting starts after the delay period ends. The delay period is set to allow community members to discuss the proposal before voting.

### Voting

Once a proposal is submitted, community members can vote on it. The voting process ensures that decisions are made democratically and reflect the collective will of the community.

**⚠️ Note: One vote equals one VIBES Token. The tokens are locked for the period of voting.**

**Step 1:** Open the proposal from the "All Proposals" section

### Conclusion

After the voting period ends, the results are tallied. Proposals that receive a majority vote are approved, and the necessary actions are taken to implement them.

**Step 1:** Click the "CONCLUDE" button to conclude the voting

Once the voting is concluded, the proposal will execute if the votes in favor exceed the votes against. Otherwise, the proposal will not execute, and only the voting will be concluded.

### Reclaiming Tokens

After the voting period ends, the tokens are unlocked, and you can reclaim them.

**Step 1:** Click the "RECLAIM VOTES" button to reclaim your tokens
