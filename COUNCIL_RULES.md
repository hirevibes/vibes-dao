# VibesDAO Proposal Funding Process

This document explains the steps through which a proposer receives the requested funds after a proposal is submitted and approved by the community and council members.

## Initial Fund Release

Once a proposal is submitted and voted upon, if the proposal receives more "For" votes than "Against" votes and is concluded by the proposer, the **initial requested amount** will be disbursed **immediately**. The following steps outline the process:

1. **Submit a Proposal**:
   - Proposer submit a proposal detailing the project and funding requirements.
   
2. **Voting Process**:
   - After a delay period for discussion, the community votes on the proposal.
   - One vote equals one VIBES token, and the tokens are locked during the voting period.

3. **Proposal Conclusion**:
   - If the majority of votes are "For," the proposer can conclude the proposal by clicking the "CONCLUDE" button.
   - Upon confirmation, the initial requested amount is released **immediately** to the proposerâ€™s wallet.

## Remaining Fund Release

The remaining requested amount will not be released immediately. Instead, it will be disbursed based on the review and agreement of the VibesDAO council members, who will evaluate the progress of the project through the following process:

1. **Progress Submission**:
   - The proposer is required to submit regular progress updates, including relevant details and results of the project.
   - These updates must be shared via a [GitHub Link](https://github.com/hirevibes/VibesDao-Example-Proposal), where the council members can track and verify the progress.

2. **Council Review**:
   - Council members will review the submitted progress through the provided GitHub link.
   - Based on their assessment, they will decide whether the project is meeting its milestones and objectives.

3. **Final Fund Release**:
   - If the council members are satisfied with the progress, they will approve the release of the remaining funds.
   - This decision will be communicated to the proposer, and the remaining amount will be transferred accordingly.

### Summary of Fund Release Stages:
1. **Initial Requested Amount**: Released immediately after the proposal concludes with a majority "For" vote.
2. **Remaining Requested Amount**: Released upon council approval after reviewing progress through the GitHub link.
