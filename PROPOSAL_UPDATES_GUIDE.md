## GitHub Repository Format

This format is suitable for users who prefer to manage proposal updates in a Git-based workflow. Each proposal will have its own dedicated repository containing all relevant updates and documents.

### Repo Name Format
For consistency, name the GitHub repository using the same name as the original proposal. 

### Folder Structure
The repository must adhere to the following structure:
```
vdp-123-proposal-name/
    README.md
    Updates/
        11-04-2024_Update.md
        17-04-2024_Update.md
    Documents/
        Budget.xlsx
        Progress_Report.pdf
```


### File Descriptions
- **`README.md`**: This markdown file should provide an overview of the proposal, including its purpose, scope, and any other relevant details.
  
- **`Updates/`**: This folder stores all progress updates for the proposal. Each update file should be named by the date of the update (e.g., `11-04-2024_Update.md`) and contain the following:
  - A description of the progress
  - Details on tasks completed, challenges, and next steps

- **`Documents/`**: This folder holds any supporting materials for the proposal, such as budgets, progress reports, and other resources. Files like `Budget.xlsx` and `Progress_Report.pdf` can be included here.

## Google Docs Format

This format is suitable for users who prefer a more straightforward method of submitting updates via a shared document. Google Docs allows for easy real-time collaboration.

### Template Structure
For each proposal update, use the following template format:
    
```
Proposal Title: [Insert Proposal Title]
Proposer Name: [Insert Name]

---

Date of Update: [Insert Date]

1. Overview of Current Status:
   Phase/Stage: [Describe the current phase]
   Key Activities Completed:
   - [Bullet point list of completed tasks]

2. Progress Since Last Update:
   Milestones Achieved:
   - [List of milestones since the last update]

3. Challenges and Blockers:
   Current Challenges: [Describe any issues or blockers encountered]

4. Next Steps:
   Upcoming Tasks:
   - [List of upcoming tasks]

5. Additional Notes:
   [Any extra information or comments]

```


### Instructions for Updating
1. Copy the provided template for each new update.
2. Fill in the relevant sections with current information.
3. Maintain consistency by following the same structure for every update.

### Example Document:

## Choosing the Right Method

- **GitHub Repository Format** is ideal if your proposal involves a large number of documents, ongoing updates, or collaborative efforts that benefit from version control and a structured folder system.
  
- **Google Docs Format** is better suited for simpler proposals or when you prefer a quick, easily accessible way to track updates without dealing with files and folders.
